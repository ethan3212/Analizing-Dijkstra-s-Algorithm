# Analizing-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest distance between two given points, and this program analyzes and shows the user how it works.

Encoded in this program is a virtual "map", with the locations of various vertices as well as the distances of the paths between them. Two arrays, each holding four elements,
  are used to hold vertices which will be passed to the algorithm. This program tracks the algorithm's loop counts as well as the total execution time and will aditionally list
  which vertices are visited along the path.
